==> add             --> This immediately adds an element to the scene.

==> play            --> This animates the creation of an element step-by-step, gradually drawing it on the screen.

==> scale           --> This resizes an element by a specified factor.

==> rotate          --> This rotates an element by a specified angle (in radians), turning it around its center point.

==> to_edge         --> This positions an element at a specified edge of the scene.

==> x.animate.y     --> Here, x is an object, animate is the animation directive, and y is the attribute to change.

==> always_redraw   --> This method continuously updates an element on the screen by re-evaluating its properties based on changes in other objects or variables.

==> c2p             --> Short for coords_to_point, this method converts coordinates from a "graph's coordinate" system to "screen coordinates" in the scene.
                    --> It's useful in graphing or plotting, where you need to specify points in terms of the graph's axes.
