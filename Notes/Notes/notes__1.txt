==> In Manim, an animation is typically created by defining a custom scene that inherits from the Scene class.

==> Scene is the base class in Manim that is used to define the structure of an animation.
-> It provides the methods and functionality for rendering objects, animations, and transitions.

==> The custom class will contain the logic and objects that will be animated when the scene is rendered.

==> construct is a special method in Manim's Scene class.
-> It's where you define what happens in the animation.
-> Manim will automatically call the construct method when rendering the scene.

==> The basic structure of code in Manim looks like this:
    from manim import *

    class Main(Scene):
        def construct(self):
            pass
